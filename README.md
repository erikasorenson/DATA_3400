This project presents a visual analysis of incidents in New Hampshire's 
Presidential Mountain Range, focusing on location, season, and causes. Our 
aim is to provide hikers with clear, actionable insights to enhance safety 
and preparedness in the mountains. By mapping past incidents, we hope to 
contribute to a safer hiking experience for everyone exploring this area.
